            English test on Duolingo
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            The Duolingo English Test (DET) is an online assessment tool designed to gauge a person's aptitude in four language domains: reading,
            writing, speaking, and listening. Its main objective is to evaluate non-native English speakers' English language skills for
            academic or professional settings.
            <br><br>

            Because the test is computer-adaptive, the questions are selected according to the test-taker's past responses. Compared to
            traditional standardized examinations, it enables the test to quickly and correctly determine the test taker's competency level.
            <br><br>
            Many colleges, universities, and other organizations recognize the Duolingo English Test as evidence of English language competency
            for academic or professional purposes. Results are available 48 hours after the exam, and it may be taken from any computer with a
            webcam and an internet connection.

            Test Format of the Duolingo Exam
        </h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            The Duolingo English Test is computer-adaptive, meaning that the difficulty level of the questions will adapt to the test taker's
            responses. The test is divided into two sections:
        </p>

        <ul class="ani-ul">
            <li>The first section assesses the test taker's reading and listening skills. This section consists of multiple-choice questions and
                lasts approximately 45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>The second section assesses the test taker's writing and speaking skills. This section requires the test taker to complete writing
                prompts and record spoken responses to prompts. The writing prompts may include short answer questions or more extended essays, and
                the speaking prompts may require the test taker to give a speech or answer a question. This section lasts approximately 30 minutes</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p-about">
            The entire test is online and requires the test taker to use a computer with a webcam, microphone, and reliable internet connection.
            The test is designed to be taken in one sitting, but it is possible to pause and resume it later if necessary.
        </p>

            The Duolingo English test's question kinds
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            The Duolingo English Test comprises multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate an individual's English language proficiency. The
            following are some instances of the kinds of questions that could be on the test:

        </p>

            <li>Multiple choice questions require the test-taker to select the right response from a list of possibilities.</li>
            <li>Complete the blank: The test-taker is required to fill in the missing word to finish a sentence or phrase.</li>
            <li>Matching: The test-taker is required to match terms or items with the explanations or descriptions that go with them.
            </li>

        </ul>


        <h4 class="h4-about ">
            A brand-new kind of interactive listening question
        </h4>


        <p class="p-about">
            A communication strategy known as "interactive listening" requires listening intently and actively in order to understand what the
            other person is saying and to react correctly. Open-ended inquiries designed to elicit lengthy elaborations from speakers are known
            as interactive listening questions. By posing insightful queries, summarizing what they heard, and offering comments, these
            questions assist listeners in demonstrating interest, reiterating attentiveness, and dispelling uncertainties. Some examples of
            these inquiries are: Could you elaborate on that for me? What was your reaction to that? What did you learn most from that? Thus,
