        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            India is a thriving nation that is spreading its roots around the globe; its younger population is exhibiting the greatest
            performances on the global stage. The IELTS is becoming more and more popular among students; each year, over 2.9 million people
            take the test. Because the IELTS exam is widely accepted by academic institutions in Australia, the UK, the USA, Canada, Europe,
            Germany, China, and New Zealand, students who take it have many chances to study in English-speaking nations. Thus, students who are
            keen to continue their education overseas should get in touch with indowest, the rapidly expanding international IELTS
            coaching facility. Let's talk a little bit about the IELTS test before I tell you more about our educational company.

            Acknowledgment for IELTS
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            The Cambridge English Language Assessment created the IELTS, a condensed version of the International English Language Testing
            System, in 1980. Because of its unpopularity at the time, fewer pupils took the exam. As a result, an effort to revise the exam was
            initiated in an effort to improve its acceptance. In this first event, the British Council and the Cambridge English Language
            Assessment shook hands with the worldwide Development Program of Australian Universities and Colleges (IDP), a reputable worldwide
            organization. Since then, the exam has been governed and administered globally by the British Council, IDP: IELTS Australia, and
            Cambridge English

            IELTS Subject Areas
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            The test was divided into distinct categories in the past. However, after revision in 1995, two more categories were created, which
            are as follows:
            <br><br>
            <b> 1. IELTS Academic: </b> IELTS Academic is designed for those who wish to enroll in universities and other higher education establishments,
            as well as professionals who wish to study or work in an English-speaking nation, such nurses and doctors.

            <b> 2. General instruction IELTS: </b> IELTS General Training is designed for people who want to obtain job experience, enroll in
            non-academic training programs, or apply for immigration.

        <p class="p-about">

            Time has changed, as we are all aware, and the internet is now omnipresent. In order to fulfill high-tech criteria, the IELTS
            authority released a new version of the test, known as computer-delivered IELTS. To ensure exam convenience, every IELTS tutoring
            institution advises selecting the appropriate exam mode. There are currently two IELTS categories called as
            <br><br>
            <b> 1.Exam format: </b> Paper-based IELTS: This exam follows a conventional format where students take the test using a pen and paper.

            <b> 2. CD-IELTS: </b> Students take the reading, writing, and listening modules on a computer when taking the computer-delivered version of
            the test. For both kinds of exams, the speaking module is administered in person.

            IELTS modules
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            Students considering taking the IELTS exam must be aware of the four modules of the IELTS exam. Listening and speaking modules are
            the same for IELTS academic and IELTS general. The only difference lies in the reading and writing module format. A good IELTS
            coaching center always gives students an idea about the difference between the two types. So, Let's discuss them in-depth today
        </p>





        <p class="p-about">
            <b>1. Listening</b>
        </p>

        <ul class="ani-ul">

            <li>The listening module is a task of 30 minutes, with an extra 10 minutes provided to transfer the answer to the answer sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Four recordings are provided to measure the listening skills of a student. Recording1 includes a two-person conversation based on
                the everyday social situation, Recording2 has a monologue on social context, Recording3 contains a conversation among four persons </li>
            <li>For each video, ten questions are asked, each with one mark for the correct answer. The total number of questions asked is 40</li>
            <li>In order to help students discover the answer at the moment they heard the material, questions are posed in the order that the
                videos play. Videos may only be shown to students once. Thus, pay close attention to what is said. A variety of conversational
                accents are used to assess the students' command of the English language</li>
            <li>The module includes multiple-choice questions (MCQs), matching, labeling plans, maps, and diagrams, form, note, table, flowchart,
                summary completion, and sentence completion.</li>
            <li>Marking criteria are based on the number of correct answers. A student can get a maximum of 40 marks and a minimum of 0. According
                to the obtained marks, bands are given to the students through the band conversion table below</li>
        </ul>

            <b>2(i). Reading(Academic)</b>
        </p>
        <p class="p-about">
            This module is considered the toughest, so students always choose a trusted IELTS coaching center to be good at the module. Find out
            the element of the reading module that puts students in trouble.

        </p>

        <ul class="ani-ul">

            <li>The module takes 60 minutes to end. And 40 questions are asked to calculate the students' English reading skills. No extra time is
                granted for the answer transmission.
            </li>
            <li>Three texts range from descriptive and date-oriented to discursive and systematic. General books, newspapers, magazines, and
                journals are the sources of the texts. The paragraphs are general readings that are written for non-technical aspirants</li>
            <li>Multiple choice questions (MCQs), information retrieval, identifying the author's opinions or assertions, information matching,
                heading matching, feature matching, sentence ending matching, sentence completion, summary completion, note completion, table
                completion, flowchart completion, diagram-label completion, and short questions-answers are some examples of the question types</li>
            <li>Every question is worth one mark, and pupils receive one mark for a right response. An incorrect answer to a question carries no
                penalty points.</li>
            <li>The amount of right answers is equal to the reading score of a student. The band conversion table is then used to convert the score
                to bands, as explained below</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="p-about">
            <b> 2 (ii). Perusing (All Categories) </b>
        </p>


        <ul class="ani-ul">
            <li>Between the IELTS general and academic versions, there are just three variations. The texts included in the modules are sourced
                from manuals, notices, pamphlets, brochures, newspapers, and periodicals, which is the first distinction.
            </li>
            <li>Content on incidents, work, interests, and daily life can be found in all three volumes</li>
            <li>Below is the band conversion table for this module.

        </p>


        <ul class="ani-ul">
            <li>The writing module demands students' command over the language. Students looking to improve their writing skills must enroll in a
                good IELTS coaching center familiar with the module's below-mentioned specifics.
            </li>
            <li>There are two assignments to complete in the 60-minute IELTS writing module</li>
            <li>In Task 1, test takers are asked to describe, in their own words, visual information presented in the form of facts and figures,
                which may include a table, graph, diagram, or chart. Students will have 20 minutes to convey the topic in 150 words or less.
            </li>
            <li>Writing an essay on the provided argument, problem, or point of view is task number two. The writing style is wholly unique.
                Students are given a word limit of 250 and forty minutes to complete their work</li>
            <li>The four factors used to compute a student's score are</li>
            <li>Task accomplishment: This assesses the task 1 response and gauges how appropriately, accurately, and properly the provided
                statistics are translated into writing form.</li>
            <li>Task Response: It assesses task 2 and looks at how test-takers put the provided statement together. Examples from personal
                experience and proofs should be included in the writing to bolster the written information. Write within the allotted word limit;
                less than 250 words will be penalized.
            </li>
            <li>Coherence and cohesion: This criterion assesses the written material's fluency and clarity as well as its organization and the
                degree to which it connects concepts, language, and information. Cohesion is the skillful use of logical conjunctions, pronouns,
                and connectors. Coherence is the process of connecting concepts through logical sequencing.
            </li>
            <li>Lexical resource: This resource looks at how widely words are used in writing in relation to the circumstances.</li>
            <li>Grammatical correctness and range: This indicates that the test requires the ability to apply grammar effectively in writing</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="p-about">
            <b> 3(ii). Writing(General) </b>
        </p>


        <ul class="ani-ul">
            <li>There are only two differences between the IELTS academic and IELTS general. First, task 1 is to write a letter explaining the
                condition according to the situation presented to the students. The letter can be in a semi-formal, formal, or personal writing
                style. The word limit for the letter is 150. Students need to complete the task in 20 minutes</li>
            <li>The second one is about the task achievement parameter. It evaluates the task 1 response and measures how suitably, precisely, and
                aptly the written letter meets the set requirements within the limit of 150 words</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="p-about">
            <b>4. Expressing </b>
        </p>


        <ul class="ani-ul">
            <li>The ability to communicate well helps students receive high exam grades. Participating in speaking exercises is encouraged for
                students attending a professional IELTS coaching center. Learn about the specifics of this module and the metrics used for
                evaluation</li>
            <li>The purpose of this activity is to assess the pupils' speaking abilities. It is split up into three sections. This module lasts for
                eleven to fourteen minutes.
            </li>
            <li> In Part 1Students' personal information was gathered during the Part 1 Introduction and Interview. In the same section, the
                examiner introduces himself and verifies the pupils' identities. Personal information includes inquiries about well-known subjects
                including name, hometown, employment, education, and interests. This section takes four to five minutes to finish.

            </li>
            <li>In Part 2, often known as the lengthy turn portion, test takers discuss a specific subject from the cue card provided by the
                examiner. You have one minute to be ready for the speech by taking some rough notes with a pen and paper. Test takers get one to
                two minutes to speak. This takes three to four minutes to complete.</li>
            <li>Part 3, the discussion, involves a short conversation on the cue-card topic between a test taker and examiner for 4-5 minutes.
                Students need to justify the given reasons and opinions in their speech.

            Punjab and Haryana's IELTS Reality Testa
        </h4>




        <p class="p-about">

            We are credited with creating the IELTS reality test, which has increased student interest. Its foundation was primarily laid in
            order to support students during their IELTS training. Students find it challenging to determine their academic level during the
            preparation period and lose their way. Additionally, some students find that even when they are prepared for the test, they
            nevertheless perform poorly. Every student has benefited greatly from the IELTS reality test, which has helped to obscure these
            issues.
            <br><br>
            As they take the test, students can assess themselves and be ready for the big test. They also learn about their areas of strength
            and weakness. They can therefore work on the shortcomings. The exam is given all year round in the well-known cities of Punjab and
            Haryana. To make reservations, students must go to the "ieltsrealitytest.com" portal. Since students can only schedule the exam at
            their preferred location for 699, it is well worth the pennies
