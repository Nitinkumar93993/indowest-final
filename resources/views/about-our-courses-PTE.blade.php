        <p class="p-about">
            Globalization is deeply ingrained everywhere and encourages students to embrace new approaches to learning in order to improve their
            progress in both technical and soft skills. Students that study abroad have an excellent opportunity to experience professional
            success. However, traveling overseas requires a great deal of work, commitment, and money—it's not as easy as ABC. Thus, during the
            drawn-out process of studying abroad, students always proceed cautiously at each stage. Verification of English language proficiency
            is the initial step in starting the procedure.
            <br><br>
            The PLC group, which is in charge of creating PTE exams, includes Pearson Language Tests. The Pearson Test of English, or PTE, is a
            tool used to evaluate non-native speakers of English's communication abilities. PTE Academic and PTE General are the two categories
            of PTE exams. These scenario-based tests are meant to assess a candidate's proficiency in English. Before we discuss the importance
            of PTE coaching, let's examine the distinctions between the two forms of PTE

            The module for writing and speaking
        </h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            This module assesses students' writing and speaking abilities. Eight subsections are used to assess various English proficiency
            levels. We'll talk about each of them individually now.
            <br><br>
            <b> Personal Introduction: </b> The purpose of this warm-up is to let pupils settle in for the impending speaking and listening exercises.
            Students don't have to worry about this session because it isn't utilized for scoring. Pupils can read the prompt on the screen and
            get ready for the answer in 25 seconds. After that, you have 30 seconds to record your response.
            <br><br>
            <b> Read aloud: </b> This assignment only requires you to speak loudly as you read the text that is presented on the screen. The activity
            has a word count of sixty and you are given all the time you need to finish it. Students have thirty to forty seconds to read the
            material and prepare. The recording time begins as soon as you hear the beep sound. Don't talk before the recording time starts,
            please.
        </p>
        <ul class="ani-ul">
            <li>Talk clearly and loudly, and don't rush things</li>
            <li>Make sure the reading text is finished before the endpoint is shown on the progress line</li>
            <li>Students may only register their answers once.</li>
            <li>Should a pause last longer than three seconds, the recording will immediately cease</li>
            <li><b> Repeat Sentence: </b> It has to do with the test of speaking and listening comprehension. Pupils are given a 3–9 second recording, and
                they have 15 seconds to record their answer. The microphone opens to record the response once the audio concludes. It is important
                that you repeat exactly what you hear in the audio </li>
            <li>Talk clearly and in a positive tone</li>
            <li>Speaking must be finished before the progress line reaches the endpoint.
            </li>
            <li>There is just a single recording.</li>
            <li><b> Retell lecture: </b> This exercise assesses the speaking and listening skills of the students. An audio-visual lecture is given to the
                students to watch and listen to. The lecture can last up to ninety seconds. Students have ten seconds to compose their response once
                the lecture ends. Students have forty seconds to record their response. As soon as you hear the beep sound, which indicates that
                recording has begun, begin speaking</li>
            <li>Talk with assurance and use the proper pronunciation</li>
            <li>It is required to finish speaking before the progress meter reaches the endpoint</li>
            <li>There is just one recording made</li>
            <li>You can also jot down brief notes on the desk's notepad while you're listening to a lecture in the meantime</li>

            <li> <b> Respond to brief inquiries: </b> The task involves speaking and listening to gauge the candidates' performance. Along with the image on
                the screen, students must listen to a recording of questions that plays for three to nine seconds. When the beep sound sounds,
                candidates have ten seconds to respond to the question in one or two words</li>
            <li>You can only listen to the clip, so pay close attention when you hear the audio.</li>
            <li>Respond to the query with assurance and clarity</li>
            <li>Before the progress bar reaches the final point, stop speaking</li>
            <li> <b> Summarize written material: </b> This exercise evaluates the candidates' writing and reading comprehension. The written text is up to
                300 words long. In ten minutes, students must write a summary of the material. Try to keep your summary to one phrase, no more than
                75 words, and include the salient points of the subject. Writing space is provided at the end of the topic with the options of cut,
                copy and paste, and word count facility</li>

                away. The entire assignment has been allocated twenty minutes. You have access to a writing space with word count convenience that
                allows you to cut, copy, and paste text. Make sure the essay is no more than 200–300 words in length</li>

            2. Module for Reading
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            This module uses five different question kinds to assess candidates' reading proficiency. PTE tutors always focus on educating their
            students completely about these patterns. We will take each lesson one at a time here.
            <br><br>
            <b> Reading & Writing: Fill in the Blanks: </b> This kind of question involves displaying a text on the screen that is around 300 words long,
            but some words are missing. Every gap has a button that opens a drop-down menu with the option to fill it. Students must use the
            left-click option to select the most acceptable term. Using the same option, one can modify the word if they think it is
            inappropriate. The purpose of this activity is to evaluate your writing and reading skills.
            <br><br>
            <b> This reading exercise : </b>, which has multiple choice and multiple answer options, actually measures pupils' reading proficiency. You
            have to read a paragraph that is no more than 300 words and respond to a multiple-choice question. The right answer may come from
            more than one choice. Decide on your response properly. Click the mouse's left button to select the choice. In a similar vein, you
            can alter the choice.
            <br><br>
            <b> Reorder Paragraphs: </b> Rearranging a paragraph is provided as a way to assess students' mastery of the reading module. Unorganized
            text appears as boxes on the screen. Students must make the correct order by dragging the box on the right side of the screen in the
            correct sequence. To drag the box, you need to click the left button on the mouse to select the box and hold the button to drag it
            to your desired position. Similarly, you can change the position of boxes as per your need.
            <br><br>
            <b> Fill in the Blanks: </b> The reading assignment assesses reading comprehension. There are multiple pauses between the roughly 80 words
            that make up the text. You are also provided with a list of words in the blue box at the bottom of the screen to help you fill in
            the blanks. Select the best appropriate word to fill in the gaps from the list of possible words. You can fill in the blank space by
            clicking and dragging a word to the correct location with the mouse left button. You can also swap out the word for another in the
            same manner.
            <br><br>
            This question type is identical to the multiple-choice, multiple-answer kind. It is known as multiple choice, single response. The
            fact that there is just one right response makes all the difference. The remaining steps in the process are the same
        </p>

        <h4 class="h4-about ">
            3. The Module for Listening
        </h4>





        <p class="p-about">
            The purpose of this module is to evaluate students' listening proficiency. There are eight different question types in all, which
            represent the breadth of listening proficiency. Thus, use caution when taking the test, especially this module, and make an effort
            to enroll in PTE coaching to become familiar with these trends.
            <br><br>
            <b> Summarize Spoken Text: </b> This listening and writing exercise evaluates students' English language skills. Students should listen
            carefully because they only get one chance to hear the recording, which lasts for about 60 to 90 seconds. After listening to the
            entire audio, you are expected to produce a 50–70 word synopsis that highlights the important ideas and points made in the <br><br>
            recording. The students have ten minutes in total, which includes listening to the tape, thinking about the subject, and writing a
            brief summary. There is also a word count option and a writing field with choices for copying, cutting, and pasting.
            <br><br>
            <b> This multiple-choice : </b> multiple-answer test is solely designed to gauge a candidate's listening comprehension abilities. A 40–90
            second recording plays at the start of the task. After that, you must respond to the query. Choose each of the correct answers that
            apply, as there may be more than one. You have one chance to listen to the recording, so make sure you pay close attention.
            <br><br>
            <b> Fill in the Blanks: </b> Students' English proficiency is assessed through listening and writing exercises. With occasional pauses, a
            recorded script appears on the screen for 30 to 60 seconds. In order to identify the missing words, you must pay close attention to
            the audio. You can take notes and fill in the blank at the conclusion of the audio while it's playing. The term must be typed into
            the spaces.
            <br><br>
            <b> Emphasize Accurate Synopsis: </b> It helps gauge comprehension and listening abilities. The beginning of a recording lasts approximately
            30 to 90 words. Taking into account the spoken information, you must choose the best summary. It is advisable to jot down any notes
            as you listen to the tape. And then read the summaries to select the best match.
            <br><br>
            <b> This is a listening : </b> exercise with multiple choice and single answer options. A 30-to 90-second recording starts and ends. You have
            to select the right response to the question based on what the recording says. Select just one option because there is only one
            right response to the question.
            <br><br>
            <b> Choose Missing Word: </b> This task involves listening. You are allowed to listen to the incomplete recording for a duration of 20 to 70
            seconds. Choose the absent words from the provided list to finish the recording. Be mindful of the recording, as it is only
            accessible once.
            <br><br>
            <b> Emphasize Wrong Words: </b> It assesses reading and listening comprehension. A text transcript that has been recorded plays for fifteen
            to fifty minutes on the screen. There are a few textual problems in the transcript that the students must fix. You can mark and fix
            the mistakes as you listen to and read the tape. Because of the mistakes, certain words in the text are not the same as those
            <br><br>
            <b> uttered on the recording: </b> You must substitute the appropriate terms for those ones.
            Write from Dictation: This test assesses the candidates' ability to write and listen. A three to five second audio clip that speaks
            one sentence plays. Students are to write the same sentences with correct spelling in the writing space
