            Dependent Visa Canada | Indo-West
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            Moving to Canada has grown increasingly popular these days because of its hospitable culture,
            top-notch educational system, and abundance of job prospects. Canada is the greatest place to
            immigrate because of its robust economy and low crime rate. In addition, the Canadian government
            permits citizens, PR residents, and work permit holders (over the age of 18) to bring their
            dependents (spouses, children, parents, or grandparents) in order to foster family reunion. With
            offices in Australia, Canada, and India, IndoWest is the top immigration advisor for all
            immigration-related services. To find out more about qualifying requirements, the Canada-dependent
            visa application process, etc., keep reading.
