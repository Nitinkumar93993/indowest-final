            Dependent Visa UK 2023 | Indo-West
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            Many Indian students, mostly from Punjab, are being forced to pursue other degrees as a result of the UK government's recent
            announcement that it will prevent overseas postgraduate students pursuing non-research courses from bringing dependents into the
            Kingdom on their student visas starting in January 2024. <br>

            If qualified, your spouse and child may travel with you to the UK as dependents. However, dependents' family members have to be
            residing, employed, or enrolled in school in the UK. Dependents are permitted to travel and remain in the UK with a dependent visa.

            if the child is older than 16:

            How can I get a dependent visa for the UK?
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            Ascertaining your eligibility is the first step in applying for a UK-dependent visa. After that, you must compile and submit the
            supporting documentation for each applicant. Additionally, confirm which precise visa category you are eligible to apply for with a
            dependant visa. You can visit and look around this page to find out more information if you would like to apply online on your own.
            Make an appointment for your fingerprint and picture biometrics. Next, pay the application expenses for your visa and, if necessary,
            show up for an interview. After submitting the application, you must wait to hear back about the outcome. If not, IndoWest
            offers the best opportunities for success.
