            USA 2023 Dependent Visa | indowest
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            Do you wish to bring a family member to the United States of America? So let us proceed to apply to IndoWest for a dependent
            visa." <br><br>

            The spouse and children may remain in the country and visit relatives who are citizens or holders of a dependent visa
            (living, working, or studying in the USA) if they have a dependent visa for the United States. Families with appropriate visa types
            are allowed to cohabitate in the United States with a dependent visa. As everyone is aware, the USA is the most popular destination
            for travel, education, and employment worldwide. It can be difficult to obtain a dependent visa for the United States, but Western
            Overseas assist you at every stage to make your travels overseas easier. The term "dependents" refers to the spouses or unmarried
            minor children in this context. The dependents can apply for a visa simultaneously as a scholar/student, or they are eligible to
            apply for a visa later. Please scroll below to learn the eligibility criteria, types of dependent visas in the USA, application
            process, and privileges.

            USA Dependent Visa Types
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            The status of the sponsor in the US determines the type of USA-dependent visa. While there are several ways to get dependents into
            the country, the most popular visa categories are mentioned here, provided the primary visas remain valid.

        </p>

        <h4 class="h4-about ani-headgg">
            1. Dependent Visa H4


        </h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            Spouses or children under 21 who work for U.S. citizens already under the H1-B category are eligible for the H4 dependent visa. If
            your spouse possesses a valid visa, you, as the H4 visa holder, may remain in the United States. You can even create a local bank
            account and go to school, but you won't be able to work until you have an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). Such dependents
            must complete an application on Form I-539. Additionally, unless a passport is excluded, proof of relationship (to the H-1B worker)
            must be provided, such as a marriage certificate, childbirth certificate, and current passport.
        <h4 class="h4-about ani-headgg">
            2. Dependent Visa F2

        </h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            Spouses or minor children (under 21) of US citizens studying on an F1 permit are eligible for an F2 Dependent visa. The F-2 might
            stay in place as long as the F-1 is still recognized in the United States. The F2 visa holder is not permitted to look for work
            while they are in the United States. The F1 visa holder bears the responsibility of managing the F2 visa holder's finances and
            spending. Furthermore, the F2 visa holder is limited to enrolling in full-time classes while residing in the US.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4-about ani-headgg">
            3. Dependent Visa L2

        </h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            Dependents of US citizens who are being transferred to another company in the US under the L1 category are eligible for this type of
            L2 visa. Dependents may apply for an EAD (Employment Authorization Document) work permit under this L2 (non-immigrant) visa. The
            dependents are able to work at any company in the United States with this permit. Children aren't permitted to work, though. All
            they are permitted to do is go to school. The duration of stay corresponds to that of the principal visa holder.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4-about ani-headgg">
            4. Visa Dependent J2


        </h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            Spouses or children of US citizens participating in exchange programs under the J1 category are eligible for the J2 visa type. By
            filing form I-765, visitors using this J2 dependent visa can ask the USCIS for employment authorization.
