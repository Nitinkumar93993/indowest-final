        <p class="p-about">
            The process of obtaining an Australian spouse visa consists of two steps. Firstly, the applicant must apply for a subclass 309
            temporary visa. They are eligible to apply for a permanent visa (subclass 100) once they have spent a certain amount of time in
            Australia. It's time to examine both subcategories in greater detail now.

        <p class="p-about">
            <b>Subclass 309:</b> Also referred to as a provisional visa, this visa allows you to remain, work, or study anywhere in Australia while
            you wait for the approval of your permanent visa application. With this visa, you have complete freedom to travel both inside and
            outside of Australia. Provisional visa holders may occasionally be able to enroll in free English language courses if they meet the
            requirements.
