            American Spouse VISA | Western Abroad
            More immigrants live in the United States of America than in any other country. The graph showing the number of immigrants has increased over time. Additionally, the nation has been the most preferred destination for immigrants. The ratio of immigrants is rising for a variety of reasons. Among them are immigrants who attempt to bring their foreign-national family members into the United States when they are citizens, permanent residents, or holders of green cards. These interested Americans' goals are served by family-based immigration. The most sought-after visa category under the family stream permits foreign spouses to accompany their partners in the United States: the U.S. spouse visa.

        <p class="p-about">
            As previously said, obtaining an immigrant visa enables one to obtain permanent residency in the United States; the immigration authorities in the United States have also created a certain route that applicants must go. The application process for a U.S. spouse VISA consists of two steps. To better understand how to apply for the visa, let's go into more detail about this. </p>

            citizen lodges the

            Following USCIS approval, the petition is forwarded to the National Visa Center (NVC). Next, NVC gives the petition a case number. The application then receives additional instructions, which include filling out Form DS-261 (which asks for the preferred address and agent). Following the payment of application money, NVC begins processing cases from applicants. Affidavit of Support, civil documents with application forms, and other supporting documents are among the necessary documents that must be submitted by the applicant in the interim. </p>
