            Go through each step of France student VISA process</h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            A step-by-step approach to applying for a study VISA helps a lot in getting a visa. So, let's
            learn the steps and start with the procedure.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4-about ">
            Step 1: Get your files ready</h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            It takes work to prepare your documentation, and the granting of your visa depends heavily on
            it. Therefore, to guarantee the success of the VISA, it is preferable to have your case prepared
            by a certified and knowledgeable VISA consultant.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4-about ">
            Step 2: Register online to submit a French institution's admissions application</h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            Create an account on the France campus. Complete the Campus France form (language proficiency +
            academic background, CV + SOP, etc.) and send your application online.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4-about ">
            Step 3: The interview with the professor</h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            This step in the France student visa application process is crucial. You have to show up in
            person for the interview with all required paperwork. To be able to study in France, you have to
            pass this interview.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4-about ">
            Step 4: Schedule a meeting with VFS France</h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            After the academic interview is over, schedule a meeting with the VFS-France representative.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4-about ">
            Step 5: Get your OFII form and visa from VFS.</h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            A student is required to fill out an OFII form within three months in order to confirm their
            status.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4-about ">
            Proceed with the France student visa.</h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            Although working rights information is not included in the France student visa application, it is
            a crucial feature that all students should be aware of before submitting their application.
            Under the following guidelines, foreign students are allowed to work in France by the
            immigration authority:

        <h4 class="h4-about ">
            1. Work permission while Studying</h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            A long-term visa permits students to work 964 hours per year, equivalent to 60% of full-day work.
            A student can work in various fields according to their interest and skills. Internship programs
            are available to support students financially.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4-about ">
            2. Post-study work permit</h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            Students can extend their stay in the country once they finish their studies. It requires a
            separate procedure to work on. A deal was made between India and France during the tour of Prime
            Minister Narendra Modi in 2015. This agreement allows Indian students in France to stay for 24
            months after doing the master's degree.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4-about ">
            Would you recommend France to Indian students?</h4>
        <p class="p-about">
            Students who want to know the solution to this query should speak with advisors for Indo-West
            VISAs. The company's European VISA specialists offer students the best advice and
            explain the benefits of opting to study in France. This is the ideal spot for students to
