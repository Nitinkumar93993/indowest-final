        <p class="p-about">
            Hungary is an ideal European study destination for advanced degrees, and studying there is not as
            pricey. This nation is well-known for its rich cultural heritage, tranquil landscapes, hot
            springs, and old urban areas. Hungary is known for its magnificent palaces and castles, whose
            magnificence may almost take your breath away. Given how luxurious and exquisite both hotels and
            museums are, it is difficult to distinguish between them. No matter where you travel, you cannot
            help but notice remnants of the fabled Hungarian wines

            Why Study in Hungary </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            Numerous university rankings have given Hungarian
            universities good marks, and Hungarian degrees are highly respected across borders. The European
            Association of Quality Assurance and the International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in
            Higher Education renewed their membership in the Hungarian Accreditation Committee in 2015. The
            committee is responsible for ensuring quality assurance and assessing research and education
            programs at higher education institutions. Hungary created the National Qualifications Framework
            in 2008, acting upon the European Parliament's suggestion. A European Higher Education Area
            (EHEA) where students and graduates could use prior qualifications in one country as acceptable
            entry requirements for further study in another was proposed by the 29 governments that signed
            the Bologna Declaration in 1999, including Hungary

            Admission Process
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            <b> Step 1:</b>Look up your program and university <br>

            Check out the higher education institution's website. Examine the program's description that you
            have chosen (s).

        </p>
        <p class="p-about">
            <b> Step 2:</b> Verify entry criteria and due dates <br>

            Always review the prerequisites for the degree program you're applying to before making a
            decision. Gather all of the necessary paperwork. Respect the deadline.
        </p>
        <p class="p-about">
            <b> Step 3:</b> is to apply online to the program and college of your choice. <br>

            Complete the program's online application. Next, send in or upload the necessary files. Speak
            with the college or institution to find out if there is anything further you need to do.

        </p>
        <p class="p-about">
            <b> Step 4:</b> Wait to receive confirmation from the university <br>

            The student will receive a letter of invitation from the university in the student's name,
            stating that the student has been accepted into the program for a particular time. Students are
            usually required to transfer (part of) the tuition fee before the enrolment in the academic
            period.
        </p>

        <p class="p-about">
            <b> Step 5:</b> Schedule a time and attend the interview <br>

            Make an interview appointment now, and pay a visit on the designated day. On the day of the
            interview, the student should have the visa file ready and bring it with them. Students should
            visit India's New Delhi, home of the Hungarian Embassy. The address is 2/50-M, Chanakyapuri, New
            Delhi â€“ 110021, India, on Niti Marg.
        </p>
        <p class="p-about">
            <b>Step 6: </b>Approval of Visa <br>

            Now, watch for the outcomes. I hope in less than a month you will have your visa. Once you have
            your visa, you can purchase a plane ticket to go there.
