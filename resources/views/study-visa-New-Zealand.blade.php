            The New Zealand study visa application process consists of two stages. A student applies to the
            university of their
            choice and
            reserves a seat during the first step. In the second stage, students have to submit their VISA
            application at the
            embassy. Documents
            that are both required and optional must be submitted throughout both stages. Tell us about these
