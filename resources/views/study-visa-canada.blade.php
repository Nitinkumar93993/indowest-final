            Study In Canada
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">

            According to a recent report, Indian students ranked second based on the number of students that
            migrate
            yearly to study in Canada for high-quality education. In recent statistics published online,
            thousands of
            Indian Students got their Canadian Student visas approved by IRCC (Immigration, Refugees and
            Citizenship
            Canada (IRCC)). Besides, thousands of people worldwide also migrate there to gain knowledge from its
            world-class education system.<br> <br>

            Canada is well-known for its finest education system and actively strives to attract international
            students to
            study in Canada. The Canadian government wants to double the number of international students in
            Canada in the
            coming years, as it believes this will promote greater cultural exchange and international
            cooperation. To
            achieve this goal, the Canadian government has implemented many initiatives to make it easier for
            international students to come to Canada, including reforms to the immigration system and
            improvements to
            student services. These initiatives aim to make Canada a more attractive destination for
            international
            students and to ensure that they have a positive and rewarding experience while studying in Canada.

                a favorable spot for
                study purposes. Tuition fees are also less in comparison to other countries. The average study

                barrier when they plan to study in Canada.</p>


            <li>Canada scholarships for Indian students

            </li>

                Scholarships,
                Dalhousie University Scholarships, HEC MontrÃ©al Scholarships, and more.p>


                <li>Working while studying in Canada </li>

            <p class="ani-paragraph">IRCC permits international students to work on-campus and off-campus during
                the
                course, which makes them
                financially independent. Students need no work permit during their studying time. It is an
                excellent way to
                encourage students and keep them moving.</p>


            <li>Work Privilege through Post-Graduation Work Permit Program(PGWPP)</li>

            <p class="ani-paragraph">The Canadian government provides a post-graduation work permit that allows
                students
                to work in Canada for
                up to three years after graduation without any restrictions. The job market in Canada is
                diverse, and
                students can find job opportunities in various industries, including technology, finance,

            <li>Canada Immigration benefits â€“ Express Entry and other schemes</li>

                stay and
                work in Canada once
                they complete their studies. Express Entry is a fast-processing PR program that facilitates
                students to get
                permanent residency in less time. The spouse and dependent VISA scheme also leverages students
                to unite with
                families. So, these flexible immigration services make Canada a convenient option for higher
                studies.

            How to apply for LOA â€“ Letter of Acceptance to study in Canada
        </h4>
        <p class="ani-paragraph">In Canada, before the students can apply for a study permit, they must first
            receive an
            acceptance letter, or letter of acceptance (LOA), from a Designated Learning Institution (DLI)
            approved by the
            Canadian government. Once a student receives an LOA from a DLI, they can apply for their study
            permit. This
            process can involve several steps that we will discuss in detail here. Let's start!</p>

        <ul class="ani-ul mt-">

            <li>The first step to applying for the offer letter in a DLI starts with some research to make a
                wish list of
                universities/colleges you want to enroll in.

            </li>
            <li>Canada has ten provinces and three territories in 5 different regions. Make your preferences for
                the
                province you want to settle in. Once you decide upon the area, you must pick colleges for your
                studies and
                choose a program. Select the right college/University and course per your last education
                qualification and
                stream.

            </li>
            <li>Students interested in PGWP (postgraduate work permit) programs must ensure that their chosen
                university
                offers PGWP. Be careful with that!

            </li>
            <li>After preparing a final list of the desired universities, it's time to apply for the offer
                letter. It is
                recommended to apply to at least 2-3 colleges simultaneously so that in case you get rejected
                from any
                college, there are chances of approval from other universities.

            </li>
            <li>Students can apply for an offer letter through official websites or hire a VISA consultant to
                enroll in
                the process. You need to submit the following documents to apply for the application.

            </li>


        </ul>

        <ol class="ani-ol2">
            <li>Academic certificates (as per the qualification)</li>
            <li>Character certificate</li>
            <li>Letter of recommendation (LOR): 2-3 from the principal, teacher, and program administrator</li>
            <li>SOP (Statement of purpose)</li>
            <li>SOP (Statement of purpose)</li>
            <li>CV (Curriculum Vitae)</li>
            <li>Work Experience (if any)</li>
            <li>Marriage certificate (in case married)</li>
        </ol>

        <ul class="ani-ul mt-3">

            <li>The offer letter application fee varies from college to college and may cost you between CA$ 50
                and CA$
                200 per application. In a few colleges, there are no application fees. Once you applied to the
                desired
                colleges/universities with the required Documentation, the college administrations start
                processing the
                applications to issue the LOA letter.

            </li>
            <li>Reviewing and processing the offer letter takes around four to 6 weeks. Once it gets done, the
                college
                issues the offer letter that can be conditional or unconditional to specify the seat
                availability.

            </li>
            <li>In the case of a conditional offer letter, you need to meet certain conditions as mentioned in
                the letter.
                Once you fulfill the needs, you get the unconditional final letter.

            </li>
            <li>Students need to pay tuition fees as mentioned in the offer letter. Some universities have
                policies to pay
                first-semester pay, while some ask to pay full-year fees. So, keep your funds ready to pay the
                fees. The
                average annual fee of a university in Canada is around CA$ 15,000.

            </li>
            <li>There is a certain limit of time to accept the offer letter. When you accept the offer and pay
                the fees,
                you receive a letter of acceptance (LOA) from the university.

            What is a "Canada Study permit"?
        </h4>
        <p class="ani-paragraph ani-margin">A study permit in Canada is an official document required to pursue
            the
            study program
            at any designated learning institution. It is issued by the authority of Immigration, Refugees and
            Citizenship
            Canada (IRCC). It is requisite for all foreign nationals to obtain a Canada study permit before
            arriving in

            Study permit OR Student VISA: Which term is correct?

        <p class="ani-paragraph">Sometimes, students need to be more understood and consider a study permit as a
            Canada
            student visa. A study permit can't be used for entry formalities in Canada. The Canadian government
            issues a
            study permit with a visitor visa or an electronic travel authorization (eTA) required to enter
            Canada. In
            India, it is common to use both terms as synonyms.
