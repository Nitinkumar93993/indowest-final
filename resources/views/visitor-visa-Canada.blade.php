            hese days, everyone wants to travel to Canada to see friends, family, and tourist attractions.
            A million visitors can spend up to six months traveling throughout Canada with a guest visa.
            While traveling with a visitor's visa, you are permitted to engage in cultural activities but not
            work. We at Indowest are experienced in offering prompt visa services. There are two
            varieties of Canadian visitor visas: single entry and multiple entry. An applicant may only enter
            Canada once with a single entry visa; multiple entry visas, on the other hand, permit repeated
            entries. The prerequisites for a visitor visa to Canada are outlined below.
