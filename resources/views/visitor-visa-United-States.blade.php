            Visitor Visa USA | Indo-West
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            The United States of America is a well-liked travel destination with a wide range of attractions,
            including colorful cities, distinctive sites, varied landscapes, cultural events, and leisure
            pursuits. You most certainly require a visitor visa if you plan to travel to the United States
            for tourism. The B-2 tourist visa is the most widely used form. It enables you to travel around
            the nation, take in its cultural variety, and partake in a range of tourist activities.
            <br><br>
            Do you wish to apply for a visitor's visa to the US? If so, fill out the online application
            (DS-160), pay the required visa fee, and schedule an interview at the American embassy. A visa
            officer will interview you for a visitor visa and ask you questions about your intended
            destination and financial situation in order to determine whether you qualify for the visa. To
            guarantee a seamless application process, it is imperative to review the precise requirements and
            procedures provided by the U.S. embassy.
            <br><br>

            You can enter the United States for the time period given by the immigration officer at the port
            of entry after obtaining a visiting visa. B-2 tourist visas typically permit stays of up to six
            months. The maximum duration of stay is set by the immigration officer, therefore it's crucial to
            remember that in order to keep your legal status in the nation, you must abide by the conditions
            of your visa. The United States provides many visitor opportunities, whether your plans are to
            see the natural wonders of national parks, visit well-known cities like New York, Los Angeles, or
            Chicago, or partake in a variety of cultural events.

            Types of USA Visitor Visa
        </h4>

        <p class="p-about">
            For anyone wishing to enter the nation temporarily for reasons like tourism, business travel,
            medical care, or visiting family and friends, the United States provides a variety of visitor
            visas, commonly referred to as non-immigrant visas. The following are a few of the most popular
            visitor visas for the United States: <br><br>

            <b> 1 Business Visa (B-1 Visa): </b> This type of visa is intended for people who are visiting the United
            States on business, such as to attend conferences or meetings and negotiate project contracts. It
            forbids working or finding employment in the US.
            <br><br>
            <b> 2 B-2 Visa: </b> This type of visa is intended for tourists or people who are traveling to the US to see
            family and friends. It permits travel, leisure, healthcare, social gatherings, and amateur sports
            and artistic endeavors. Furthermore, it forbids employment or labor within the United States.
            <br><br>
            <b> 3 B-1/B-2 Visa: </b> This dual-purpose visa is valid for both travel and business. B-1/B-2 visa holders
            are able to participate in activities that are allowed for B-1 and B-2 visa holders.
            <br><br>
            The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) eliminates the requirement for a visa for visitors from a number of
            nations who want to travel or conduct business in the United States. Travelers are required to
            apply for authorization via the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) prior to their
            journey.

            <li> Verify with the embassy that you will be returning from your trip.

            visa application charge must be paid. The cost may differ, so it's best to check on the
            Department of State's or the American embassy's website.
